    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Bacalhau com natas (literally "cod with cream") is a popular way of
      cooking salted cod (bacalhau) in Portugal. It is an oven-baked dish
      consisting of layers of bacalhau, onion, diced fried potato and cream,
      commonly spiced with nutmeg and white pepper.

      Use of dairy such as cream or cheese is not common in traditional
      Portuguese savoury dishes; however, the popularity of this dish—in
      households and restaurants—make it a classic. The origin of this dish is
      unclear, but a similar one using cod and cream was invented by chef João
      Ribeiro in the 1930s.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>12 ounces dried salted cod fish</li>

      <li>vegetable oil for frying</li>

      <li>4 large potatoes, peeled and cut into very small cubes</li>

      <li>½ cup olive oil</li>

      <li>1 large onion, sliced thin</li>

      <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>

      <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>

      <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>

      <li>1 cup hot milk</li>

      <li>1 pinch ground nutmeg</li>

      <li>1⅓ cups heavy cream</li>

      <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>

      <li>⅔ cup heavy cream</li>

      <li>1 ounce grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Soak the dried salted cod in cold water with the skin side up for 24
        hours, changing the water about 4 times. Drain and discard the water.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Place the cod in a pan with enough water to cover; bring to a boil and
        cook for 10 minutes. Remove the cod from the pan; remove and discard the
        skin and bones. Cut the cod into chunks and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 1/2 inch vegetable oil in large skillet over medium-high heat.
        Working in batches if necessary, fry the potatoes in the hot oil until
        just cooked, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a plate lined with paper
        towels to drain.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the olive oil into a Dutch oven or heat-proof casserole dish over
        medium heat. Cook the onion and garlic in the oil until the onion is
        translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the cod and cook another 3 minutes;
        stir the potatoes into the mixture and cook another 1 to 2 minutes.
        Reduce heat to low.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt the butter in a separate pan over medium-low heat; vigorously stir
        the flour into the melted butter. Slowly stream the hot milk into the
        mixture while stirring; cook and stir until thick. Season with the
        nutmeg. Pour into the casserole with 1 1/3 cups cream; stir to coat.
        Allow the mixture to simmer together for about 2 minutes. Season with
        salt and pepper. Drizzle remaining 2/3 cup cream over the mixture;
        sprinkle with the Parmesan cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until the top is browned, 30 to 40 minutes.
        Serve hot.
